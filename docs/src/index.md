# Julia for Data Science

This might eventually turn into a book, who knows. For now it is a work
in progress that might be useful to some.

This book will not teach you about all the packages in the julia data
ecosystem. The book describes a particular way to do data science with
julia. That approach is based on a family of packages that follow a common
philosophy and are tightly integrated with each other. While this makes
for a coherent and simple story, it does mean that there is a risk that
you are missing out on some great features in other packages if you
blindly follow the advice in this book. I try to mitigate this with a
section at the end of each chapter that points you towards alternative
packages that you can use to achieve similar outcomes as described in
that chapter.
